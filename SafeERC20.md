          require(success, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed");

          if (returndata.length > 0) { // Return data is optional
              require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");

    ```
### Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:
`abi.encodeWithSelector`, `call`, `abi.decode`

### Explanation

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the `safeTransferFrom` function is to safely transfer ERC-20 tokens from one address to another, ensuring the transaction is successful by using low-level calls and verifying the result.

**Detailed Usage:**

- **Encoding:** The function uses `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the `transferFrom` function selector and its parameters (from, to, value) into a byte array.
- **Low-level Call:** The `_callOptionalReturn` function performs a low-level call to the token contract using the encoded data.
- **Result Verification:** The function checks if the call was successful. If the call returns data, it decodes the data to ensure the ERC-20 operation succeeded. If not, it throws an error.

**Impact:**

- **Usability:** This function enhances usability by providing a safe way to transfer tokens, reducing the risk of errors and failures.
- **Security:** By verifying the success of the token transfer, it ensures that only successful transactions are processed, protecting against potential failures or malicious contracts.

### Summary
The `safeTransferFrom` function in the SafeERC20 library is crucial for safely transferring ERC-20 tokens. It leverages encoding, low-level calls, and result verification techniques to provide a reliable and secure method for token transfers, significantly contributing to the protocol's functionality and user experience within the DeFi ecosystem.
